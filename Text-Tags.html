            This is my first SIWES lecture this week. The tutor is teaching us the basics of HTML tags and how to apply them in a Coding Program. The tutor also sent us a file containing the summary of the Tags used in <mark>HTML</mark> coding and instructs us to study them.<br>

            <p><blockquote><b>A bird is known by its note, and a man by his talk.</b></blockquote> <cite>Ray, John. A Collection of English Proverbs. 1670. Bartleby.com</cite>, <a href="https://www.bartleby.com/lit-hub/proverbs-maxims-and-phrases-of-all-ages/bird/">The Proverb's Citation Link</a>.<br>
            <br>
            The above proverb has many variation across various cultures, and one of the recent variation being: <q><pre>A bird is known by its song, and a man by his words</pre></q>.<br>
            <br>
            This proverb carries the profound meaning of <i><em>Just as you can recognize a bird by the way it sings, you can recognize a person’s character by the way they speak.</em></i> <br>
